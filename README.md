# ReScience C website

The ReScience C website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and the amazing [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

The built happens automatically (with
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/rescience-c/rescience-c.github.io)) each time a
push is made to the `sources` branch. The result is also deployed automatically
on the `master` branch, as required for [github pages
organization](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).
