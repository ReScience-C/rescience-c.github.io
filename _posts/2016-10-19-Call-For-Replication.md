It is now possible to suggest an article for a replication. Just
[open a new issue](https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication/issues/new) 
in the
[call for replication repository](https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication)
and give the reference of the original article and possibly the reason you
would like to see this article replicated (please refrain from suggesting your
own work). Note that you're also encouraged to register as a reviewer such that
you can review the replication you've been proposing if someone actually takes
up the challenge.

If you're looking for some challenge, you can also look at the
[current list of suggestions](https://github.com/ReScience/call-for-replication/issues).
