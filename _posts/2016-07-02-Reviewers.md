ReScience is slowly gaining momentum and we currently have 4 submissions to
review. If you're interested in helping ReScience and reproducibility, you can
become a reviewer. What you need is a github account, a one line description of
your expertise (see the [Board](http://rescience.github.io/board/) for some
examples) and to [tell us](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/27) you're interested such that we can add you to the board. You can also [follow](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience-submission/subscription) the [submission](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience-submission) repository and propose your help whenever a submission falls into your expertise domain.
