[LabCritics](http://www.labcritics.com) kindly made a [post](http://www.labcritics.com/rescience-a-scientific-journal-with-github-at-its-core-4729/?utm_source=@labcritics) introducing Re**Science** and explaining its goals: "Computational research is set to get new open source journal solely for publishing implementations of algorithms and codes already published. Termed ReScience (Replicated Science â€“ I guess [**note**: yes]), the journal uses and exists solely on Github, a popular Web-based Git repository service, offering all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git."
